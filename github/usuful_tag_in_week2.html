    <hr>Hi, today we're gonna talk about some of the tags that you may find extremely useful as you go and try to add blocks of code and simple snippets of different things to your web page. I know that it can seem overwhelming how many tags there are in HTML5. So today, I'm going to try to break down some of the most useful ones. Now, I realize it may seem overwhelming as I said throwing all these elements at you. You're not supposed to memorize them all by the end of this lecture. Instead, I'm really just trying to give you a taste for what's out there so you can start playing with your own code.
